# GIS_portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio for 90753: Advanced GIS. This portfolio can also be viewed by visiting [https://jaxgoodlabs.github.io/GIS_portfolio/](https://jaxgoodlabs.github.io/GIS_portfolio/).

## About me 
My name is Patrick Campbell and Iâ€™m a 2nd year student in the Public Policy and Management Master's Program at Carnegie Mellon University. Before coming to CMU, I worked in a variety of positions in the areas of environmental science and conservation. Some of the more notable examples of the work I've done include 3 years managing a volunteer program at a biological research station in the Peruvian Amazon and a year and a half hunting and removing invasive Burmese pythons from the areas surrounding Everglades National Park in South Florida.

I also have many interests and pet projects outside of conservation and environmental science. As a student, I tried on majors ranging from digital media and biology (B.S.) to philosophy (M.A.) and, currently, public policy (M.S.), while dabbling in cognitive science, ecology, and social entrepreneurship. Similarly, as a professional, I've worked variously as an environmental consultant, ecotourism guide, HVAC installation technician, volunteer program manager, special education teacher, and python hunter. My most recent projects have focused on public interest technologies that help to increase the range and accessibility of social services worldwide, especially as a means of increasing society's resilience to global threats like climate change.

## What I hope to learn 
In this course, I hope to shore up tho foundational knowledge and skills I acquired in my introductory GIS course and begin digging deeper into the advanced capabilities of ArcGIS Pro, especially those that are most highly valued among my prospective employers in the fields of civic tech and environmental policy and sustainability. I also look forward to gaining exposure to additional tools and software used by GIS professionals and in integrating my knowledge of these tools with the broader base of knowledge I've acquired during my nearly two years in Heinz College, especially database management, programming, and [data visualization](https://jaxgoodlabs.github.io/campbell-portfolio/).
